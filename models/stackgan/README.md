# Implementation

This is a TensorFlow implementation based on the [StackGAN: Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03242)
papers and includes some small improvements.

## Usage

To configure the model and the training parameters, check the config in `stackgan/stage[I-II]/cfg`. For instructions on
